                                            With soaring rent prices in big cities like Addis Ababa, paying rent for a
                                            significant portion of the market in the city has become a challenge. To
                                            solved
                                            this, shared housing has been taking place, but through referrals from
                                            trusted
                                            friends and family members; this manual process doesn't work for everyone as
                                            it
                                            can be time consuming and inconvenient, since the referrals have to be at
                                            the
                                            right place and right time.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Our solution is to match people with strangers whom they have a lot in
                                            common
                                            with so as to minimize any potential conflicts in living situations. Even
                                            though
                                            there are a number of competitor applications in the market, our approach in
                                            matching users is different. This application solves the problem using two
                                            algorithms: the first filters date, price and location and the second
                                            calculates
                                            the compatibility match percentage for each filtered result.
                                        </p>

                                            Our main project objective is to design a responsive and robust web
                                            application
                                            that will match users looking for shared housing. Aside from the matching,
                                            there
                                            are a number of useful feature we shall implement, some of which include:

                                            and background queued jobs.

                                                <p>As the second most populous country in Africa, Ethiopia is currently
                                                    facing the pressure of rapid urban expansion and growing urban
                                                    housing
                                                    demand [1]. Ethiopian cities generally have a large proportion of
                                                    sub-standard housing stock and deficient affordable formal rental
                                                    market.</p>
                                                <p>According to the recent statistics, Addis Ababa, the capital of
                                                    Ethiopia,
                                                    has a population of 4.6 million [2]. The dramatic increase in
                                                    population
                                                    implies a higher demand for housing which in turn increases the need
                                                    for
                                                    residential real estate. In 2015, the housing needs reached about
                                                    2,250,
                                                    831 units, which equated to a demand of 225,000 new housing per
                                                    annum
                                                    [3].</p>
                                                <p>Housing is an essential need affecting the well-being of all
                                                    citizens.
                                                    Accordingly, providing adequate and affordable housing is a core
                                                    national policy objective, especially given its impact on
                                                    inequalities.
                                                    Lower-income households typically live in lower-quality housing; on

                                                <p>The need for renting depends on socioeconomic and demographic
                                                    dynamics.

                                                    advertise rental homes or rooms, but fail to match users.
                                                    Furthermore,
                                                    most are not focused and tend to offer a variety of services

                                                    to housing.</p>
                                                <p>In Ethiopia shared housing is mostly a manual process. Most users
                                                    have to
                                                    talk to their friends, friends of friends, and family members in

                                                    them to find a shared co-living space and minimize on rental costs.
                                                    This
                                                    process can take weeks if you are lucky, but most of the time it
                                                    usually
                                                    takes months to find the right place. Furthermore, if conflicts
                                                    arise,
                                                    you

                                                    not everyone has a family member or friend offering a co-living

                                                <p>Architectural design is the process of defining a structured solution
                                                    that meets all of the technical and operational requirements, while
                                                    optimizing common quality attributes such as performance, security,
                                                    and
                                                    manageability.</p>
                                                <p>We used the three-tier architecture layered architecture with
                                                    application
                                                    logic monolithic. The layered architecture helps with separation of
                                                    concerns, and we think for now a monolithic approach is preferable
                                                    to a
                                                    micro-service approach in the beginning since it will offer us easy
                                                    and
                                                    faster development.</p>
                                                <p>The architectural design pattern we will use in the application is
                                                    the
                                                    MVC architectural pattern. MVC consists of three parts: Model, View,
                                                    Controller. The Model handles data logic, the view displays the
                                                    information from the model to the user, the Controller controls the
                                                    data
                                                    flow into a model object and updates the view whenever the data
                                                    changes.
                                                </p>

                                                    calculating compatibility match is a time consuming task that could
                                                    significantly slow down the system, we therefore, used queued jobs

                                                    defer the matching processing to run in the background as the user
